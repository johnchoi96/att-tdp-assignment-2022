Hello all,

Thank you for taking your time to review my submission.
My implementation of this assignment is in Java (developed under JavaSE-11).

To start the program from the terminal, invoke the following commands:

1. javac *.java
2. java Main

Behavior:
This program, when started, will ask for the inputs until the empty string is entered (Enter key).
Inputs should be separated by lines, so for example, enter to the console:

Carrie,06/13/1982,Steven King,762 <ENTER>
I Robot,08/29/1945,Isaac Asimov,474 <ENTER>
The Jungle Book,09/17/1900,Rudyard Kipling,483 <ENTER>
Kim,02/03/1910,Rudyard Kipling,526 <ENTER>
Mockingjay,08/09/2014,Suzanne Collins,642 <ENTER>
<ENTER>

to perform the inputs to the program.

As stated in the requirements, each line contains title, date, author, and page length separated by comma.
It is also limited to take in only 4 known authors, and the program will ignore input if the author is unknown.

Thank you again for reviewing my submission.

Best,
John Choi
